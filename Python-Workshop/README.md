# Using Replit
Replit is a great online environment which allows you to jump directly to what you care about: coding. Nevertheless, it has its limitations. As you get comfortable with Python, it is recommended that you switch to installing Python and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) locally on your computer. Furthermore, you may want to use Python on an Alliance cluster. Here's the official wiki: https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Python

## 0. Environment overview
The Repl.it environment comes bundled with several components.

### 0.1 Side panel
On the left, you will notice a set of icons that give you access to different tools. Today we'll focus on the following:

#### 0.1.1 Files
The Files section provides a file explorer. Here, you can see your project folder and manage all the files inside it.

#### 0.1.2 Settings
This tool will allow you to personalize your environment. I recommend that you enable 'code intelligence' which will provide you hints while typing (similar to the typing suggestions in you phone's keyboard).

#### 0.1.3 Console
The console is where we'll find our code's output.

### 0.2 Editor
When you click on a file, an editor tab will be added. The editor is where you open and modify the project files. We will use it to write our code. The editor can open a variety of file types.

### 0.3 More about the console
The console has several functions. It allows us to write and execute code on the fly. This is useful when running a few lines of code. However, we will quickly notice that running many lines of code from a file is easier and better.

The console also allows us to interact with the code that we run from a file. It allows us to see the output of our code and even interact with it after the program has finished executing.

### 0.4 Run button
At the very top, above the editor panel, you'll find the run button. This button runs the `main.py` file (which you will find in the Files section).

> Try it yourself!
> - Enable the code intelligence setting
> - Create an empty folder
> - Create a text file and edit it
> - Use the console as a calculator, try `345 + 876`
